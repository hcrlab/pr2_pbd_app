To use programmatically use actions that you've saved with this tool, take a look at the [action_manager node](https://github.com/hcrlab/pr2_pbd_app/blob/pose-saver/pr2_pbd_interaction/nodes/action_manager.py). You can either run the node and use its services to load/execute actions, or you can use similar code to do the same.
